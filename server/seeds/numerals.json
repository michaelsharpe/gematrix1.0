perceives, with that watcher, that all activity is a series of transformation of the energy of subconsciousness  He knows that the self moves not, nor enters into any action  He knows that it as the eternal witness of the activities of its own power  3  (Nun: Key 13: Death) A Master of the Temple perceives that necessity and the beneficence of the continual transformation of physical vehicles  He sees that this principle of endless change in the world of form brings about the appearance of death  He does more than see  He has grasped the affirmative factor in the phenomenon of Death  he has borrowed strength form the eagle by using nerve currents which in ordinary men have no outlet save through the sex-function  A Master of the Temple employs these currents to stimulate certain parts of

Heh-Peh-Ayin, are related to the Mars vibration  Heh through Aries, ruled by Mars  Peh through its attribution to Mars itself  Ayin through the sign Capricorn, in which Mars is exalted  The secret is evidently primarily a current of brain activity, or reason, of what Qabalist call 'constituting intelligence', since the first letter is Heh  It was also to do with the special functions of the Mars center in the body, the center behind the navel, corresponding to Peh and the Tower  And again, it is a secret which has to do with the direction of the current of the astral light  And this magical agent, which is the force employed in all magical operations, it what is represented in Tarot by the 15th key, inasmuch as Elphas Levi tells us that the astral light is the devil of exoteric dogmatism  The next three letters Vav-Lamed-Vav, are related to the Venus vibration  Occultly, Venus is the complement of Mars, as green, its color, is the complement to red color of Mars  Vav (Hierophant) represent hearing, complementary to sight, which is attributed to Heh and the Emperor  When we have learned the deeper meaning of vision (Heh), have mastered this destructive electric force (Peh) and have exalted that force by learning how to use the uniting power of Saturn which at first appears to us an adversary (Ayin), we are ready for the deeper revelations of the mysteries which come to us, through the channel of interior hearing, direct from the one teacher symbolized by the hierophant  Lamed (Justice), the letter corresponding to the sign Libra, ruling the kidneys and lumbar region of the spine, suggest that the physical part of the secret has something to do with elimination, and with the functions of the suprarenal capsules    and the Qabalah, by making the letter representing Karma one which also is associated with the Venus vibration, intimates plainly that the manipulation of Karma is possible for any person which has learned to control his desires  This, you see, is practically what is symbolized by the fact that the woman in the 8th key of the Tarot is leading the lion by a chain of roses-the flower of Venus  The letter Vav is repeated in HPOVLVTh, I have been taught, because the inner teacher makes the revelation in imparting the greater secret  The first revelation has to do with the purification, and with the attainment of balance  Thus is leads on, so to say, the actual work which is represented by the letter Lamed  the second revelation is that the teacher is the real self, and it includes the knowledge that the adversary has been the father in disguise  Teth (Strength) is the final letter of HPOVLVTh    when self-consciousness, by right intellection, grasps the truth that all the power any man can exercise is a transformation of the one life-power, that all the volition a man feels at work within him are expression of the one will, then this right knowledge of the relation between personality, and the one life becomes the dominate suggestion to subconsciousness, the woman of the 8th Key  In response to this dominant suggestion all the body-building activities are directed to the fashioning of a perfect personal vehicle, which offers no obstruction to the safe outflow of the life-power into the externalizations of the objective plane of name and form    The completion of this process is the radiant, deathless, beautiful body of a master of life \" [Paul Case: True and Invisible Rosicrucian Order (3rd), p 110-112]","see":[]}]},{"numeral":206,"word":"BRD","definition":"

the inclusion of the evil serpent which be fouled the moon and separated it from the sun; thus causing the earth to be cursed [Genesis 3:17]  the word IHI Yehi being in the singular shows that the
